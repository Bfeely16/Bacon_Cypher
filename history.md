# History of Bacon Cypher 
Bacon’s cipher or the Baconian cipher is a method of steganography (a method of hiding a secret message as opposed to just a cipher) devised by Francis Bacon in 1605. A message is concealed in the presentation of text, rather than its content.
The Baconian cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter is replaced by a sequence of 5 characters. In the original cipher, these were sequences of ‘A’s and ‘B’s e.g. the letter ‘D’ was replaced by ‘aaabb’, the letter ‘O’ was replaced by ‘abbab’ etc. Each letter is assigned to a string of five binary digits. These could be the letters ‘A’ and ‘B’, the numbers 0 and 1 or whatever else you may desire.
